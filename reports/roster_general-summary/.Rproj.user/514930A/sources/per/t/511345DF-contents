## Summary
[Chaclyn decide what facts you want here]

## Background
The complaints against members of the Chicago Police Department, summarized here, originate from incidents occuring from `r niceDate(min(cmpl$incident_date, na.rm=T))` to `r niceDate(max(cmpl$incident_date, na.rm=T))`. There are a total of `r pnum(length(unique(cmpl$cr_id)))` unique CR (complaint registery (?)) numbers in these complaints.
A single CR number can correspond to multiple officers accused of misconduct in the same incident.
In total, `r pnum(length(unique(acc$cr_id)))` unique CR numbers/incidents resulting in `r pnum(nrow(acc))` complaints filed against `r pnum(length(unique(acc$UID)))` CPD officers. The data on the victims of these complaints is more sparse than that of the accused officers. Only `r pnum(length(unique(vict$cr_id)))` incidents have victim information, and `r pnum(length(unique(cmplnt$cr_id)))` incidents have complainant information. `r pnum(length(unique(wit$UID)))` officers are listed as witnesses for `r pnum(length(unique(wit$cr_id)))` unique complaints.

The CPD has had 3 major oversight regimes from 2000 to 2017. [DESCRIBE]

# Complaints
## Overview
```{r cmpl_overview, cache = TRUE, dependson = "introduction"}
rm(vict, cmplnt, wit)

cmpl <- cmpl %>%
  mutate(district = if_else(! is.na(beat) & beat > 1,
                            beatToDistrict(as.character(beat)), NA_real_),
         incident_month = floor_date(ymd(incident_date), 'month'),
         incident_year = year(incident_date)) %>%
  select(cr_id, incident_date, incident_month, incident_year, incident_time,
         complaint_date, closed_date, district, complaint_class) %>%
  full_join(acc)

cym_tbl <- cmpl %>%
  select(incident_month, UID, cr_id) %>% 
  unique() %>% 
  filter(incident_month < max(incident_month)) %>%
  select(incident_month) %>%
  table()

cym_pi_tbl <- cym_tbl[names(cym_tbl) >= IPRA_Active]
cmpl_xts <- cmpl %>% 
  filter(!is.na(UID)) %>% 
  mutate(incident_month = as.Date(incident_month)) %>% 
  group_by(incident_month) %>% 
  summarize(Complaints = n(),
            Sustained = sum(as.numeric(final_finding=='SU'), na.rm = T)) %>% 
  tk_xts(.)

cmpl.full <- cmpl
```
The number of complaints filed declines greatly over time, reaching a peak of `r pnum(sort(cym_tbl, decreasing = T)[[1]])` complaints in a single month in `r niceDate(names(sort(cym_tbl, decreasing = T)[1]), form='ym')`, and steadily dropping until the lowest complete month of data, `r niceDate(names(sort(cym_tbl)[1]), form='ym')`, with only `r pnum(sort(cym_tbl)[[1]])` complaints filed.
There are two main periods in this data set, before IPRA (Indepedent Police Review Authority) and after IPRA, which was announced on `r` and put in place on `r`. 

IPRA changed the way many complaints were received and investigated.
There is a noticable drop off in the number of complaints in the pre-IPRA period, reaching a low of `r pnum(sort(cym_pi_tbl)[[1]])` complaints in `r niceDate(names(sort(cym_pi_tbl)[1]), form='ym')`.
The number of complaints per month rises briefly in the post-IPRA period, until `r niceDate(names(sort(cym_pi_tbl, decreasing = T)[1]), form='ym')`, at `r pnum(sort(cym_tbl, decreasing = T)[[1]])` when the number of complaints peaked and declined almost continously until the end of the data.

As the complexity of any analysis would be greatly increased if data before IPRA was fully functional would increase dramatically, due to the obscurity and lack of accomplaintsability which prompted the reforms that led to IPRA's creation, the rest of the summary will focus on the the period `r niceDate(sample_start_ym, form='ym')`, to our last full month of data `r niceDate(sample_end_ym, form='ym')`. This period is shown in the gray shading. Over the entire period, the number of complaints that are sustained, also shown on the plot below, remains abysmally low in comparison with the shear number of complaints.

```{r cmpl_overview_dygraph, cache=TRUE, dependson="cmpl_overview", results='asis', fig.width=7}
dygraph(tk_xts(cmpl_xts), main = "Complaints over time") %>% 
  dyRangeSelector() %>% 
  dyLegend(width = 500) %>%
  dyAnnotation(IPRA_Active, text = "IPRA", width = 50, height=30, attachAtBottom=T) %>%
  dyShading(from = IPRA_Active, to = '2007-10-01', color='#EE4242') %>%
  dyOptions(stackedGraph = TRUE) %>%
  dyShading(from = sample_start_ym, to = sample_end_ym)

rm(cym_pi_tbl, cym_tbl, cmpl_xts)
```

## Sample Complaints
```{r sample, cache=TRUE, dependson="cmpl_overview"}
cmpl %<>% 
  filter(!is.na(UID), 
         between(incident_month, sample_start_ym, sample_end_ym)) %>%
  unique()

prof <- read_csv("input/final-profiles.csv.gz") %>% select(c("UID", "race", "gender", "birth_year", "appointed_date")) %>%
  mutate(gender = recode(gender, MALE = 'Male', FEMALE = 'Female', .default='Unknown'),
         race = recode(race, BLACK = 'Black', HISPANIC = 'Hispanic', WHITE = 'White', .default = 'Other'))

```
The observations kept for the majority of this analysis occured between `r niceDate(sample_start_ym, 'y')` and `r niceDate(sample_end_ym, 'y')`, while IPRA was fully active and there is sufficient time for complaints to be investigated and a final finding (sustained, no sustained, exonerated, etc.) to be determined, and had identified officers accused of misconduct. A total of `r pnum(nrow(cmpl))` complaints resulted from `r pnum(length(unique(cmpl$cr_id)))` incidents, accusing `r pnum(length(unique(cmpl$UID)))` unique officers.
The complaint count declined by `r round((nrow(subset(cmpl, incident_month==sample_start_ym)) - nrow(subset(cmpl, incident_month==sample_end_ym)))/nrow(subset(cmpl, incident_month==sample_start_ym)), 4) * 100` percent over this time period,  from `r pnum(nrow(subset(cmpl, incident_month==sample_start_ym)))` complaints in the first month to `r pnum(nrow(subset(cmpl, incident_month==sample_end_ym)))` complaints in the last.

## Complaints by Region
```{r by_region, cache=TRUE, dependson="sample"}
Min.District <- 1
Max.District <- 30

cmplt <- cmpl %>%
  select(district, incident_month) %>%
  filter(between(as.numeric(district), Min.District, Max.District)) %>%
  mutate(region = as.factor(districtToRegion(district)))
```
Chicago is divided up into `r length(unique(subset(cmpl, between(as.numeric(district), Min.District, Max.District))$district))` geographic districts-- though, in the past decade, these district boundaries have changed slightly. `r pnum(nrow(subset(cmpl, between(as.numeric(district), Min.District, Max.District))))` complaints in the relevant data have viable district numbers. These districts can be broken into three regions of Chicago: North, Central, and South.

```{r by_region_plot, cache=TRUE, dependson="by_region", fig.height = 5, fig.width = 7}
cmplt %>% 
  group_by(incident_month, region) %>% 
  summarize(Complaints=n()) %>%
  ggplot(., aes(x=incident_month, y = Complaints, color=region, group=region)) + 
  geom_point(position='jitter') +
  geom_smooth(method = 'loess', span=0.1, alpha=0.1) + 
  ggtitle("Complaints by Region") + 
  labs(x = "Incident Month", y = "Complaints", color='Region') +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.9, 0.9))
rm(cmplt)
```

## Complaint Category
```{r complaint_category}

```
HOW DO WE WANT TO BREAK THESE DOWN?

# Accused Officers
```{r accused, cache=TRUE, dependson="sample"}
cmpl.ot <- merge(cmpl, prof, by = 'UID', all.x =T) %>% 
  mutate(region = as.factor(districtToRegion(district))) %>%
  filter(!is.na(UID)) %>%
  select(cr_id, UID, gender, race, birth_year, appointed_date, 
         region, incident_month, closed_date, incident_date,
         incident_year, final_finding, recommended_finding, complaint_class) %>% 
  mutate(age_at_complaint = incident_year - birth_year,
         tenure_at_complaint = incident_year - year(appointed_date),
                    `Age at Incident` = cut(age_at_complaint, 
                                            breaks = c(20,30, 40, 50, 90), 
                                            include.lowest=TRUE),
                    `Tenure at Incident` = cut(tenure_at_complaint, 
                                              breaks = c(0,5, 10, 15, 20, 50), 
                                              include.lowest=TRUE))
```
There were `r pnum(length(unique(cmpl.ot$UID)))` officers which were named in `r pnum(nrow(cmpl.ot))` complaints during the relevant period. The composition of officers accused of misconduct are roughly representative of the racial composition of the police force as a whole, but the upper ranks of the CPD are underrepresented (as would be expected) and thus older, white male officers are underrepresented. Additionally, female officers are noticably underrepresented relative to male officers.

```{r accused_table, results='asis', cache=TRUE, dependson="sample"}
niceTableStacked(cmpl.ot, 'race', c('gender', 'Age at Incident', 'Tenure at Incident', 'region'), scroll=F, caption = 'Complaints by Accused Officer Race')
```

## Unique Officers
```{r unique_accused, cache=TRUE, dependson="accused"}
cmpl.otu <- cmpl.ot %>%
        group_by(UID) %>%
        summarise(Complaints = n(),
                  race=max(race),
                  gender=max(gender),
                  birth_year=max(birth_year),
                  `Officer Filed` = sum(as.numeric(complaint_class=='Officer')),
                  `Civilian Filed` = sum(as.numeric(complaint_class=='Civilian')),
                  Sustained = sum(as.numeric(final_finding=='SU' & !is.na(final_finding))))

cmpl.otu <- cmpl.otu %>% mutate(`Total Complaints` = cut(Complaints, 
                                           breaks = c(1,2,4,6,8,10,12, 14,18,26, 
                                                      max(cmpl.otu$Complaints)),
                                           include.lowest=TRUE))

cmpl_dist_table <- round(prop.table(table(cmpl.otu$Complaints)) * 100, 2)
cmpl_break <- 10
cmpl_break2 <- 26

otu <- cmpl.otu %>% mutate(Male=as.numeric(gender=='Male'),
                    Female=as.numeric(gender=='Female'),
                    age = 2015 - birth_year) %>%
  select(c("Male", "Female", "race", 'age', 'Complaints','Officer Filed', 'Civilian Filed', 'Sustained'))
otu1 <- otu %>% select(-race) %>% summarise_all(funs(round(mean(.), 2))) %>% t()
colnames(otu1) <- 'All'

otu2 <- otu %>%  group_by(race) %>% summarise_all(funs(round(mean(.), 2))) %>% t()
colnames(otu2) <- otu2[1,]
otu2 <- otu2[-1, ]
otu_table <- cbind(otu2, otu1)
otu_table <- rbind(otu_table,
                   rbind(addmargins(table(unique(cmpl.otu[, c("race", "UID")])$race)),
                         round(addmargins(100 * prop.table(table(unique(cmpl.otu[, c("race", "UID")])$race))), 2)))
rownames(otu_table)[c(nrow(otu_table)-1, nrow(otu_table))] <- c("N","%")
```
White officers comprise a majority of the officers accused of misconduct (`r otu_table['%', 'White']`%), while blacks make up a slightly larger share (`r otu_table['%', 'Black']`%) than Hispanics (`r otu_table['%', 'Hispanic']`%). Black officers are noticably more female (`r otu_table['Female', 'Black']`) than other races, reflecting the relative make up of the CPD in general. In terms of age, black officers (`r otu_table['age', 'Black']`) are older than whites (`r otu_table['age', 'White']`), and Hispanics (`r otu_table['age', 'Hispanic']`) are the youngest.

Officers accused of misconduct have, on average, `r otu_table['Complaints', 'All']` complaints each, with Hispanics (`r otu_table['Complaints', 'Hispanic']`) having slightly more than whites (`r otu_table['Complaints', 'White']`) and blacks (`r otu_table['Complaints', 'Black']`). However, black officers have clealry less civilian complaints (`r otu_table['Civilian Filed', 'Black']`) and more officer complaints (`r otu_table['Officer Filed', 'Black']`) than other races. This may be related to the difference in number of sustained complaints, with blacks at `r otu_table['Sustained', 'Black']` sustained complaints on average, while white and Hispanic officers have on average `r otu_table['Sustained', 'White']` and `r otu_table['Sustained', 'Hispanic']` sustained complaints, respectively.

```{r results='asis', cache=TRUE, dependson="unique_accused"}
kable(otu_table, 'html', caption = "Unique Accused Officers") %>%
  kable_styling(c("striped", "bordered")) %>%
  group_rows("Demographics", 1, 3) %>%
  group_rows("Complaints", 4, 7) %>%
  group_rows("", 8, 9,label_row_css = "background-color: #D7261E")
```

##Distribution of Complaints
The distribution of the number of total complaints per officer with complaints is unsurprisingly skewed. `r cmpl_dist_table[['1']]`% of these officers only have 1 complaints, and about half (`r sum(cmpl_dist_table[1:3])`%) have 3 or fewer complaints. Similarly, `r round(100 * sum(cmpl.otu[cmpl.otu$Complaints>=cmpl_break, 'Complaints'])/sum(cmpl.otu$Complaints), 0)`% of all complaints belong to the `r nrow(cmpl.otu[cmpl.otu$Complaints>=cmpl_break, 'Complaints'])` officers in the top `r round(100 * nrow(cmpl.otu[cmpl.otu$Complaints>=cmpl_break, 'Complaints'])/(nrow(cmpl.otu)), 2)`%, each having more than `r cmpl_break` complaints. There are `r nrow(cmpl.otu[cmpl.otu$Complaints>=cmpl_break2, ])` officers with `r cmpl_break2` total complaints or more each; these officers, just `r round(100 * nrow(cmpl.otu[cmpl.otu$Complaints>=cmpl_break2,])/(nrow(cmpl.otu)), 2)`% of officers with complaints are responsible for `r round(100 * sum(cmpl.otu[cmpl.otu$Complaints>=cmpl_break2, 'Complaints'])/sum(cmpl.otu$Complaints), 0)`% of all complaints. The shares of each total complaint bracket becoming increasingly (~50% to ~60%) as the number of complaints per officer increases. Black officers' share declines slightly, while Hispanic officer share increases slightly as total complaints increase.
```{r total_complaints, cache=TRUE, dependson="unique_accused", fig.height=6, fig.width=7}
p1 <- cmpl.otu %>% ggplot(., aes(x = `Total Complaints`, fill=race)) + geom_bar() + labs(y='Officers') + rotate

p2 <- cmpl.otu %>% group_by(race, `Total Complaints`) %>% summarise(count = n()) %>% group_by(`Total Complaints`) %>% mutate(`% of Officers` = 100 * count/sum(count)) %>% ggplot(., aes(x = `Total Complaints`, y=`% of Officers`, group=race, color=race)) + geom_line() + geom_point() + rotate

grid_arrange_shared_legend(p1, p2, ncol=2, nrow=1)
rm(p1,p2, otu, otu1, otu2, otu_table, cmpl_dist_table)
```

## Complaint Outcomes
```{r outcomes, cache=TRUE, dependson="unique_accused"}
cmpl.f <- cmpl.ot %>% 
  filter(! is.na(final_finding), ! is.na(recommended_finding), ! is.na(closed_date)) %>%
  filter(incident_year <= 2015) %>%
  mutate(final_findingf = factor(final_finding),
         complaint_class_nice = paste(complaint_class, " Filed"))
ff_table <- round(prop.table(table(cmpl.f$final_finding)) * 100,2)
```
Of the `r pnum(nrow(cmpl.ot))` complaints with identified officers in the period of examination, `r pnum(nrow(cmpl.f))` have non-missing Recommended and Final Findings, non-missing investigation close dates, and had between 2008 and 2015 (at the time the data was received 2016 complaints did not have ample time to be investigated). There are `r length(unique(cmpl.f$final_finding))` complaint outcomes.


### Outcomes for Civilian vs. Officer Complaints
From the plots below, it is clear that civilian complaints are much more likely to not have an affidavit signed compared to officer complaints. Similarly, given an affidavit is signed, officer complaints are fairly likely to end in a sustained (SU) finding.

```{r outcome_compare, cache=TRUE, dependson="outcomes", fig.height=7}
cols <- gg_color_hue(length(unique(cmpl.f$final_findingf)))
names(cols) <- levels(unique(cmpl.f$final_findingf))
p1 <- cmpl.f %>%  ggplot(., aes(x=incident_year, fill=final_findingf)) + geom_bar(position='fill') + scale_fill_manual(values=cols) + facet_grid(~complaint_class_nice) + ggtitle("Complaint Outcome") + scale_y_continuous(labels=scales::percent) + labs(x = "Incident Year", y = "Cumulative Percent", fill='Final Finding')

p2 <- cmpl.f %>% filter(final_findingf!="NAF") %>% ggplot(., aes(x=incident_year, fill=final_findingf)) + geom_bar(position='fill') +  scale_fill_manual(values=cols) + facet_grid(~complaint_class_nice) + ggtitle("Outcome Given a Signed Affidavit") + scale_y_continuous(labels=scales::percent) + labs(x = "Incident Year", y = "Cumulative Percent", fill='Final Finding')
grid_arrange_shared_legend(p1,p2, nrow=2, ncol=1)
rm(p1,p2)
```

### Outcomes by Officer Demographics
```{r outcome_demos, cache=TRUE, dependson="outcomes"}
cc_table <- round(cbind(prop.table(table(subset(cmpl.f, complaint_class=='Civilian' & final_finding !='NAF')$final_finding,
                                         subset(cmpl.f, complaint_class=='Civilian' &  final_finding!='NAF')$race),2),
                  prop.table(table(subset(cmpl.f,complaint_class=='Civilian' & final_finding!='NAF')$final_finding)))* 100,2)
colnames(cc_table)[5] <- c("All")

oc_table <- round(cbind(prop.table(table(subset(cmpl.f,complaint_class=='Officer' & final_finding!='NAF')$final_finding,
                                         subset(cmpl.f,complaint_class=='Officer' &  final_finding!='NAF')$race),2),
                  prop.table(table(subset(cmpl.f, complaint_class=='Officer' & final_finding!='NAF')$final_finding))) * 100,2)
colnames(oc_table)[5] <- c("All")

occ_table <- cbind(cbind(cc_table,c("")) ,oc_table)
```
Given an affidavit was signed, officer complaints maintain an astoundingly larger sustained rate (`r oc_table['SU', 'All']`%) than civilian complaints (`r cc_table['SU', 'All']`%). However, in both officer and civilian filed complaints, black officers accused of misconduct are more likely to be sustained against. Accusations by officers against black officers are `r oc_table[ 'SU', 'Black']`% sustained, compared the sustained percent of white and Hispanic officers (`r oc_table['SU', 'White']` and `r oc_table['SU', 'Hispanic']`, respectively). In civilian complaints, accusations against black officers are `r cc_table['SU', 'Black']`% sustained, compared the sustained percent of white and Hispanic officers (`r cc_table['SU', 'White']` and `r cc_table['SU', 'Hispanic']`, respectively).

```
### Outcomes by Previous Outcomes
The plot below displays the likelihood of a complaint against an officer being sustained with respect to number of complaints the officer has received (including the one in question). From this, it appears that the likelihood of a complaint being sustained is highest when it is the officer's first complaint, and declines as the number of cumulative complaints the accused officer has increases.

Over the period of analysis, complaints resulting in No Affidavit (NAF) hold a consistent plurality (`r ff_table[['NAF']]`% of all outcomes), while the number of complaints that are sustained (SU) is abysmally low (`r ff_table[['SU']]`% of all outcomes). The share of complaints resulting NAF begins at `r subset(cmpl.fy, incident_year==min(incident_year) & final_finding=='NAF')$pct`% of outcomes for complaints in `r min(cmpl.fy$incident_year)` and declines steadily to a low of `r min(subset(cmpl.fy, final_finding=='NAF')$pct)`% in `r subset(subset(cmpl.fy, final_finding=='NAF'), pct == min(pct))$incident_year`, then rises steadily to `r min(subset(cmpl.fy, final_finding=='NAF')$pct)`% in `r subset(subset(cmpl.fy, final_finding=='NAF'), pct == max(pct))$incident_year`.  The rate of sustained findings remains relatively constant, only fluctuating between `r min(subset(cmpl.fy, final_finding=='SU')$pct)`% and `r max(subset(cmpl.fy, final_finding=='SU')$pct)`% in `r subset(subset(cmpl.fy, final_finding=='SU'), pct == min(pct))$incident_year` and `r subset(subset(cmpl.fy, final_finding=='SU'), pct == max(pct))$incident_year`, respectively.

            select(cr_id, incident_month) %>% 
            mutate(`Identified Complainant` = as.numeric(cr_id %in% cmplnt$cr_id),

```

In the complainant and victim data sets, a total of `r pnum(length(unique(cmplnt$cr_id)))` complaints have any complainant and `r pnum(length(unique(vict$cr_id)))` complaints have any victim information. Rarely, there are multiple victims and/or complainants. Complainant and victim information is very sparse before `r niceDate(min(subset(cmpl_cv, pct_cmplnt <= 60)$incident_month), 'ym')`, and, though complainant information is more common than victim information, both become substantially more common. Complainant information is significantly more common than victim information until `r niceDate(min(subset(cmpl_cv, incident_month > '2007-01-01' & pct_cmplnt < pct_vict)$incident_month))`, after which victim information is more common.

## Complainants and Victims in Sample
Focusing on the sample of complaints, it is clear that victim information is inconsistent for both civilian and officer filed complaints, but complainant information is almost fully known for officer filed complaints. Civilian filed complaints also have relatively consistent complainant information, but there is a considerable drop off in 2015.

```{r cv_sample_cc_plot, fig.height=5, fig.width=7, cache=TRUE, dependson='cv_sample'}

      mutate(`Identified \nComplainant` = if_else(complainant==1, 'Yes', 'No')) %>%

Some officers act as witnesses in the investigations of other officers accused of misconduct. `r pnum(length(unique(wit$UID)))` unique officers with identifiable information were witnesses in `r pnum(length(unique(wit$cr_id)))` complaints in `r nrow(wit)` witness-complaint combinations. `r pnum(length(intersect(wit$cr_id, cmpl$cr_id)))` of these complaints are in the sample of analysis, and will be used in the rest of this section.

Witness officers are demographically similar to accused officers, in race, age, and gender. Interestingly, almost all witness officers (`r 100 * as.numeric(wtu_table['In Complaints', 'All'])`%) are named in the full accused officer data.

Investigators fall into two categories: police officer acting as investigators and civilian investigators from IPRA (post creation of IPRA). WE STILL HAVE NOT HAD A GOOD DISCUSSION ABOUT INVESTIGATORS AND HOW TO BREAK THEM DOWN
