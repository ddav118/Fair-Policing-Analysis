# Introduction 
Through combining `r` unit history files, unit movement from `r` to `r` is known for `r` officers. The average officer has `r` unit changes. There are `r` unique units over the course of this data. Unit names are known for `r` of these units, which were obtained directly in a list of units and in directly through a roster file. Some units, such as `r`, have multiple names.

# Core Units

The most common units are the `r` core units which designate geographic regions for police officers (non-detective/specialized/ranking officers), which are numbered units `r` through `r`.

# Training Unit
Another popular unit is `r`, which designates a training unit for new officers.

# Detective Unit

# Special Unit
