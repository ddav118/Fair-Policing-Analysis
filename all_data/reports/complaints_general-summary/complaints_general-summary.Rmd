```
This document is a general summary of the complaint data received via Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to the Chicago Police Department (CPD) and the Independent Police Review Authority (IPRA), which was received in November of 2016. This data set contains information on complaints filed against police officers by other police officers and civilian, the classifications and outcomes of those complaints, complainants, victims, police officers acting as witnesses, and investigators. This is summary is meant as a brief overview of the complaints data, including trends, data quality issues, and historical context.

The complaints in this data correspond to incidents occuring between `r niceDate(min(cmpl$incident_date, na.rm=T))` and `r niceDate(max(cmpl$incident_date, na.rm=T))`. There are a total of `r pnum(length(unique(cmpl$cr_id)))` complaint registry (CR) numbers in this data. A single CR number will be referred to as a 'complaint'; a single complaint may name zero, one, or multiple officers, and each CR x officer combination will be referred to as an 'accusation', generally referring to accusations with identified officers; while in reality, a single accusation may be comprised of multiple 'allegations', meaning an officer in a complaint can be alleged to have committed multiple infractions (e.g. a single CR x officer combination having excessive force, uniform violation, and failure to provide services allegations) but in our data this level of granularity does not exist, so every accuation only has 1 allegation.

As noted, single complaint can correspond to multiple officers accused of misconduct. In total, there are `r pnum(length(unique(acc$cr_id)))` unique CR numbers resulting in `r pnum(nrow(acc))` accusations filed against `r pnum(length(unique(acc$UID)))` CPD officers. The data on the victims of these complaints is more sparse than that of the accused officers. Only `r pnum(length(unique(vict$cr_id)))` complaints have victim information, and `r pnum(length(unique(cmplnt$cr_id)))` complaints have complainant information. `r pnum(length(unique(wit$UID)))` officers are listed as witnesses for `r pnum(length(unique(wit$cr_id)))` unique complaints.


Due to the time frame of this data, it encompasses multiple oversight regimes for the Chicago Police Department. As of 2007, with the introduction of IPRA ..... EXPLAIN... a complaint can be filed....

The data set provided is by no means complete for various reasons: some complaints (`r pnum(length(setdiff(cmpl$cr_id, acc$cr_id)))`%) have no accused officer as they were not identified by the complainant; complainant and victim information are both rare before IPRA, but victim information remains less common than complainant information until the end of the data; complaint categories may not be accurate due to changing codes over time. Such inconsistencies and holes are common and will be more adquately explored in the rest of the document, but the full extent of the data's incompleteness is not known.

There are a few key findings from this data listed below:

* Of the `r` complaints with named officers and concluded investigations, only `r` (`r`%) were sustained.
* The number of complaints filed dropped `r`% from 2000 to 2007, and `r`% from 2007 to 2015.
* Of complaints with complainant information, `r`% of these complaints were filed by Black individuals
* The sustained rate of black complainants is `r`%, while hispanics have complaints systained at `r`%, and whites have `r`% complaints sustained.
* Black officers are more likely to have complaints against them sustained, at `r`%, compared to White officers at `r`%.

# Background
Complaints against CPD officers are routed through several investigative bodies. Most complaints are investigated internally. Minor allegations are investigated by an officer’s supervisors, while more serious complaints are handled by the CPD’s Bureau of Internal Affairs. Some [types](http://copadev.wpengine.com/investigations/jurisdiction/) of serious complaints, including use of force, racial slurs, and domestic violence are investigated by non-police investigators. Beginning in 1974, these cases were handled by the Office of Professional Standards ([OPS](https://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports98/police/uspo55.htm)), which employed civilian investigators but was still part of the CPD. After a series of police scandals in 2007, OPS was replaced with a new civilian agency, the Independent Police Review Authority ([IPRA](https://southsideweekly.com/the-origins-of-ipra/)), which operated outside of the CPD. In September 2017, in the wake of the killing of Laquan McDonald, IPRA was also deemed ineffective and replaced by another civilian oversight agency, the Civilian Office of Police Accountability ([COPA](http://www.chicagocopa.org/)).

# Complaints
## Overview
```{r cmpl_overview, cache = TRUE, dependson = "introduction"}
rm(vict, cmplnt, wit)

cmpl <- cmpl %>%
  mutate(district = if_else(! is.na(beat) & beat > 1,
                            beatToDistrict(as.character(beat)), NA_real_),
         incident_month = floor_date(ymd(incident_date), 'month'),
         incident_year = year(incident_date)) %>%
  select(cr_id, incident_date, incident_month, incident_year, incident_time,
         complaint_date, closed_date, district, complaint_class) %>%
  unique() %>%
 full_join(acc, by='cr_id')

stopifnot(nrow(keepDuplicates(cmpl)) == 0)

cym_tbl <- cmpl %>%
  select(incident_month, UID, cr_id) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(UID)) %>%
  unique() %>% 
  filter(incident_month < max(incident_month)) %>%
  select(incident_month) %>%
  table()

cym_pi_tbl <- cym_tbl[names(cym_tbl) >= IPRA_Active]
cmpl_xts <- cmpl %>% 
  filter(!is.na(UID)) %>% 
  unique() %>%
  mutate(incident_month = as.Date(incident_month)) %>% 
  group_by(incident_month) %>% 
  summarize(Accusations = n(),
            Sustained = sum(as.numeric(final_finding=='SU'), na.rm = T)) %>% 
  tk_xts(.)

cmpl.full <- cmpl
```
A total of `r pnum(nrow(cmpl))` accusations resulted from `r pnum(length(unique(cmpl$cr_id)))` complaints. Of these, `r pnum(nrow(subset(cmpl, !is.na(UID))))` accusations and  `r pnum(length(unique(subset(cmpl, !is.na(UID))$cr_id)))` complaints had accused officers, accusing `r pnum(length(unique(cmpl$UID)))` unique officers.

The number of accusations (and complaints) filed declines greatly over time, reaching a peak of `r pnum(sort(cym_tbl, decreasing = T)[[1]])` accusations in a single month in `r niceDate(names(sort(cym_tbl, decreasing = T)[1]), form='ym')`, and steadily dropping until the lowest complete month of data, `r niceDate(names(sort(cym_tbl)[1]), form='ym')`, with only `r pnum(sort(cym_tbl)[[1]])` accusations.
There are two main periods in this data set, before IPRA (Indepedent Police Review Authority) and after IPRA, which was announced on `r` and put in place on `r`. 

IPRA changed the way many complaints were received and investigated.
There is a noticable drop off in the number of accusations in the pre-IPRA period, reaching a low of `r pnum(sort(cym_pi_tbl)[[1]])` accusations in `r niceDate(names(sort(cym_pi_tbl)[1]), form='ym')`.
The number of accusations per month rises briefly in the post-IPRA period, until `r niceDate(names(sort(cym_pi_tbl, decreasing = T)[1]), form='ym')`, at `r pnum(sort(cym_tbl, decreasing = T)[[1]])` when the number of accusations peaked and declined almost continously until the end of the data.

As the complexity of any analysis would be greatly increased if data before IPRA was fully functional would increase dramatically, due to the obscurity and lack of accountability which prompted the reforms that led to IPRA's creation, the rest of the summary will focus on the the period `r niceDate(sample_start_ym, form='ym')`, to our last full month of data `r niceDate(sample_end_ym, form='ym')`. This period is shown in the gray shading. Over the entire period, the number of accusations that are sustained, also shown on the plot below, remains low in comparison with the shear number of accusations.

```{r cmpl_overview_dygraph, cache=TRUE, dependson="cmpl_overview", results='asis', fig.width=7}
dygraph(tk_xts(cmpl_xts), main = "Accusations Over Time") %>% 
dyRangeSelector() %>% 
dyLegend(width = 500) %>%
dyAnnotation(IPRA_Active, text = "IPRA", width = 50, height=30, attachAtBottom=T) %>%
dyShading(from = IPRA_Active, to = '2007-10-01', color='#EE4242') %>%
dyOptions(stackedGraph = TRUE) %>%
  dyShading(from = sample_start_ym, to = sample_end_ym)

rm(cym_pi_tbl, cym_tbl, cmpl_xts)
```

## Sample Complaints
```{r sample, cache=TRUE, dependson="cmpl_overview"}
cmpl <- cmpl %>% 
  filter(!is.na(UID), 
         between(incident_month, sample_start_ym, sample_end_ym)) %>%
  unique()
```
The observations kept for the majority of this analysis occured between `r niceDate(sample_start_ym, 'y')` and `r niceDate(sample_end_ym, 'y')`, while IPRA was fully active and there is sufficient time for accusations to be investigated and a final finding (sustained, no sustained, exonerated, etc.) to be determined, and had identified officers accused of misconduct. During the sample period, total of `r pnum(nrow(cmpl))` accusations resulted from `r pnum(length(unique(cmpl$cr_id)))` complaints. Of these, `r pnum(nrow(subset(cmpl, !is.na(UID))))` accusations and  `r pnum(length(unique(subset(cmpl, !is.na(UID))$cr_id)))` complaints had accused officers, accusing `r pnum(length(unique(cmpl$UID)))` unique officers.
The accusation count declined by `r round((nrow(subset(cmpl, incident_month==sample_start_ym)) - nrow(subset(cmpl, incident_month==sample_end_ym)))/nrow(subset(cmpl, incident_month==sample_start_ym)), 4) * 100` percent over this time period, from `r pnum(nrow(subset(cmpl, incident_month==sample_start_ym)))` accusations in the first month to `r pnum(nrow(subset(cmpl, incident_month==sample_end_ym)))` accusations in the last.

These districts can be broken into three regions of Chicago: North, Central, and South. -->

# Accused Officers
```{r active_officers, results='asis', cache=TRUE, dependson='introduction'}
active_officers <-prof %>% 
  filter(appointed_date <= sample_end_ym & 
         (is.na(resignation_date) | 
          resignation_date >= sample_start_ym))
```

```{r accused, cache=TRUE, dependson="sample"}
cmpl.ot <- merge(cmpl, prof, by = 'UID', all.x =T) %>% 
  mutate(region = as.factor(districtToRegion(district))) %>%
  filter(!is.na(UID)) %>%
  select(cr_id, UID, gender, race, birth_year, appointed_date, 
         region, incident_month, closed_date, incident_date,
         incident_year, final_finding, recommended_finding, complaint_class) %>% 
  mutate(age_at_complaint = incident_year - birth_year,
         tenure_at_complaint = incident_year - year(appointed_date),
         `Age at Incident` = cut(age_at_complaint, 
                                 breaks = c(20,30, 40, 50, 90), 
                                 include.lowest=TRUE),
         `Tenure at Incident` = cut(tenure_at_complaint, 
                                    breaks = c(0,5, 10, 15, 20, 50), 
                                    include.lowest=TRUE))
```
There were `r pnum(length(unique(cmpl.ot$UID)))` officers which were named in `r pnum(nrow(cmpl.ot))` accusations during in the sample period (between `r niceDate(sample_start_ym, form='ym')` and `r niceDate(sample_end_ym, form='ym')`. There were roughly `r pnum(nrow(active_officers))` active officers during this period, meaning about `r pcnt(length(unique(cmpl.ot$UID))/nrow(active_officers))`% of active officers were accused of misconduct-- though a few of these accused officers may not have actually been active during the time of their accusations. The composition of officers accused of misconduct is roughly representative of the racial composition of the police force as a whole, but the upper ranks of the CPD are underrepresented (as would be expected) and thus older, white male officers are underrepresented. Additionally, female officers are noticably underrepresented relative to male officers across all races.

```

## Unique Officers
```{r unique_accused, cache=TRUE, dependson="accused"}
cmpl.otu <- cmpl.ot %>%
  group_by(UID) %>%
  summarise(Accusations = n(),
            race=max(race),

            `Civilian Filed` = sum(as.numeric(complaint_class=='Civilian')),
            Sustained = sum(as.numeric(final_finding=='SU' & !is.na(final_finding))))

cmpl.otu <- cmpl.otu %>% mutate(`Total Accusations` = cut(Accusations, 
                                                         breaks = c(1,2,4,6,8,10,12, 14,18,26, 
                                                                    max(cmpl.otu$Accusations)),
                                                         include.lowest=TRUE))

cmpl_dist_table <- round(prop.table(table(cmpl.otu$Accusations)) * 100, 2)
cmpl_break <- 10
cmpl_break2 <- 26

otu <- cmpl.otu %>% mutate(Male=as.numeric(gender=='Male'),
                           Female=as.numeric(gender=='Female'),
                           age = 2015 - birth_year) %>%
  select(c("Male", "Female", "race", 'age', 'Accusations','Officer Filed', 'Civilian Filed', 'Sustained'))
otu1 <- otu %>% select(-race) %>% summarise_all(funs(round(mean(.), 2))) %>% t()
colnames(otu1) <- 'All'

otu2 <- otu %>%  group_by(race) %>% summarise_all(funs(round(mean(.), 2))) %>% t()
colnames(otu2) <- otu2[1,]
otu2 <- otu2[-1, ]
otu_table <- cbind(otu2, otu1)
otu_table <- rbind(otu_table,
                   rbind(addmargins(table(unique(cmpl.otu[, c("race", "UID")])$race)),
                         round(addmargins(100 * prop.table(table(unique(cmpl.otu[, c("race", "UID")])$race))), 2)))
rownames(otu_table)[c(nrow(otu_table)-1, nrow(otu_table))] <- c("N","%")
```
White officers comprise a majority of the officers accused of misconduct (`r otu_table['%', 'White']`%), while blacks make up a slightly larger share (`r otu_table['%', 'Black']`%) than Hispanics (`r otu_table['%', 'Hispanic']`%). Black officers are more likely to be female (`r 100 * as.numeric(otu_table['Female', 'Black'])`%) than other races, reflecting the relative make up of the CPD in general. In terms of age, black officers (`r otu_table['age', 'Black']`) are older than whites (`r otu_table['age', 'White']`), and Hispanics (`r otu_table['age', 'Hispanic']`) are the youngest. Given the age and gender differences between officers of different races, some differences in number of accusations is to be expected.

Officers accused of misconduct have, on average, `r otu_table['Accusations', 'All']` accusations each, with Hispanics (`r otu_table['Accusations', 'Hispanic']`) having slightly more than whites (`r otu_table['Accusations', 'White']`) and blacks (`r otu_table['Accusations', 'Black']`). However, black officers have clealry less civilian accusations (`r otu_table['Civilian Filed', 'Black']`) and more officer accusations (`r otu_table['Officer Filed', 'Black']`) than other races. This may be related to the difference in number of sustained accusations, with blacks at `r otu_table['Sustained', 'Black']` sustained accusations on average, while white and Hispanic officers have on average `r otu_table['Sustained', 'White']` and `r otu_table['Sustained', 'Hispanic']` sustained accusations, respectively.

```

## Distribution of Accusations
The distribution of the number of total accusations per officer with accusations is unsurprisingly skewed. `r cmpl_dist_table[['1']]`% of these officers only have 1 accusation, and about half (`r sum(cmpl_dist_table[1:3])`%) have 3 or fewer accusations Similarly, `r round(100 * sum(cmpl.otu[cmpl.otu$Accusations>=cmpl_break, 'Accusations'])/sum(cmpl.otu$Accusations), 0)`% of all accusations belong to the `r nrow(cmpl.otu[cmpl.otu$Accusations>=cmpl_break, 'Accusations'])` officers in the top `r round(100 * nrow(cmpl.otu[cmpl.otu$Accusations>=cmpl_break, 'Accusations'])/(nrow(cmpl.otu)), 2)`%, each having more than `r cmpl_break` accusations There are `r nrow(cmpl.otu[cmpl.otu$Accusations>=cmpl_break2, ])` officers with `r cmpl_break2` total accusations or more each; these officers, just `r round(100 * nrow(cmpl.otu[cmpl.otu$Accusations>=cmpl_break2,])/(nrow(cmpl.otu)), 2)`% of officers with accusations are responsible for `r round(100 * sum(cmpl.otu[cmpl.otu$Accusations>=cmpl_break2, 'Accusations'])/sum(cmpl.otu$Accusations), 0)`% of all accusations.

```{r total_accusations, cache=TRUE, dependson="unique_accused", fig.height=6, fig.width=7}
cmpl.otu %>% ggplot(., aes(x = `Total Accusations`, fill=race)) + geom_bar() + labs(y='Officers') + rotate
rm(otu, otu1, otu2, otu_table, cmpl_dist_table)
```

## Complaint Outcomes
```{r outcomes, cache=TRUE, dependson="unique_accused"}
cmpl.f <- cmpl.ot %>% 
filter(! is.na(final_finding), ! is.na(recommended_finding), ! is.na(closed_date)) %>%
filter(incident_year <= 2015) %>%
mutate(final_findingf = factor(final_finding),
complaint_class_nice = paste(complaint_class, " Filed"))
ff_table <- round(prop.table(table(cmpl.f$final_finding)) * 100,2)
```
Of the `r pnum(nrow(cmpl.ot))` accusations with identified officers in the period of examination, `r pnum(nrow(cmpl.f))` have non-missing Recommended and Final Findings, non-missing investigation close dates, and had between `r year(sample_start_ym)` and `r year(sample_end_ym)`. Accusations with missing findings are either the result of poor data collection, or, more likely, an investigation being incomplete, and thus no recommended or final finding is recorded. There are `r length(unique(cmpl.f$final_finding))` outcomes: Sustained (SU), Not Sustained (NS), Unfounded (UN), Exonerated (EX), and No Affidavit (NAF). These terms, other than No Affidavit, which means the complainant did not sign an affidavit and thus no investigation was likely to take place, are described below in the 2017 DoJ Report (not that the report uses 'complaint' in place of 'accusation') CITE THIS:

> “Sustained” means the complaint was supported by sufficient evidence to justify disciplinary action. “Not sustained” means the evidence was insufficient to either prove or disprove the complaint. “Unfounded” means the facts revealed by the investigation did not support the complaint (e.g., the complained-of conduct did not occur). “Exonerated” means the complained-of conduct occurred, but the accused officer’s actions were proper under the circumstances.

### Outcomes for Civilian vs. Officer Complaints
A complaint (containing one or many accusations) can be filed by either a civilian (non-police officer) or a police officer against a member of the CPD. All accusation outcomes within a complaint do not have to be the same. From the plots below, it is clear that civilian complaints are much more likely to not have an affidavit signed compared to officer complaints. Similarly, given an affidavit is signed, officer complaints are fairly likely to end in a sustained (SU) finding.

```{r outcome_compare, cache=TRUE, dependson="outcomes", fig.height=7}
cols <- gg_color_hue(length(unique(cmpl.f$final_findingf)))

Given an affidavit was signed, officer complaints maintain an astoundingly larger sustained rate (`r oc_table['SU', 'All']`%) than civilian complaints (`r cc_table['SU', 'All']`%). However, in both officer and civilian filed complaints, black officers accused of misconduct are more likely to be sustained against. Accusations by officers against black officers are `r oc_table[ 'SU', 'Black']`% sustained, compared the sustained percent of white and Hispanic officers (`r oc_table['SU', 'White']` and `r oc_table['SU', 'Hispanic']`, respectively). In civilian complaints, accusations against black officers are `r cc_table['SU', 'Black']`% sustained, compared the sustained percent of white and Hispanic officers (`r cc_table['SU', 'White']` and `r cc_table['SU', 'Hispanic']`, respectively).

### Outcomes by Previous Outcomes [UNCERTAIN ABOUT THIS SECTION]
The plot below displays the likelihood of an accusation against an officer being sustained with respect to number of complaints the officer has received (including the one in question). From this, it appears that the likelihood of a complaint being sustained is highest when it is the officer's first complaint, and declines as the number of cumulative complaints the accused officer has increases.

Over the period of analysis, complaints resulting in No Affidavit (NAF) hold a consistent plurality (`r ff_table[['NAF']]`% of all outcomes), while the number of complaints that are sustained (SU) is abysmally low (`r ff_table[['SU']]`% of all outcomes). The share of complaints resulting NAF begins at `r subset(cmpl.fy, incident_year==min(incident_year) & final_finding=='NAF')$pct`% of outcomes for complaints in `r min(cmpl.fy$incident_year)` and declines steadily to a low of `r min(subset(cmpl.fy, final_finding=='NAF')$pct)`% in `r subset(subset(cmpl.fy, final_finding=='NAF'), pct == min(pct))$incident_year`, then rises steadily to `r min(subset(cmpl.fy, final_finding=='NAF')$pct)`% in `r subset(subset(cmpl.fy, final_finding=='NAF'), pct == max(pct))$incident_year`.  The rate of sustained findings remains relatively constant, only fluctuating between `r min(subset(cmpl.fy, final_finding=='SU')$pct)`% and `r max(subset(cmpl.fy, final_finding=='SU')$pct)`% in `r subset(subset(cmpl.fy, final_finding=='SU'), pct == min(pct))$incident_year` and `r subset(subset(cmpl.fy, final_finding=='SU'), pct == max(pct))$incident_year`, respectively.

In the complainant and victim data sets, a total of `r pnum(length(unique(cmplnt$cr_id)))` complaints have any complainant and `r pnum(length(unique(vict$cr_id)))` complaints have any victim information. Occassionally, there are multiple victims and/or complainants. Complainant and victim information is very sparse before `r niceDate(min(subset(cmpl_cv, pct_cmplnt <= 60)$incident_month), 'ym')`, and, though complainant information is more common than victim information, both become substantially more common. Complainant information is significantly more common than victim information until `r niceDate(min(subset(cmpl_cv, incident_month > '2007-01-01' & pct_cmplnt < pct_vict)$incident_month))`, after which victim information is more common.

## Complainants and Victims in Sample
Focusing on the sample of complaints, it is clear that victim information is inconsistent for both civilian and officer filed complaints, but complainant information is almost fully known for officer filed complaints. Civilian filed complaints also have relatively consistent complainant information, but there is a considerable drop off in 2015.

```{r cv_sample_cc_plot, fig.height=5, fig.width=7, cache=TRUE, dependson='cv_sample'}
p1 <- cmplnt %>% 
  select(cr_id, complainant, complaint_class, incident_year) %>% 
  unique() %>%

grid.arrange(p1, p2, ncol=1, nrow=2)
rm(p1, p2)
```

## Demographics
```{r cv_demos, cache=TRUE, dependson="cv_sample"}
ctable <- cmplnt %>% filter(complainant==1) %>%
  select(c("gender", "race", 'age', 'complaint_class')) %>%

         age_group = cut(age, 
                         breaks = c(0,30, 45, 65, 110), 
                         include.lowest=TRUE))

vtable <- vict %>% filter(victim==1) %>%
  select(c("gender", "race", 'age', 'complaint_class')) %>%
  mutate(race = recode(race,
                       'ASIAN/PACIFIC ISLANDER' = 'Other', 
                       'NATIVE AMERICAN/ALASKAN NATIVE' = 'Other',
                       .default = str_to_title(race)),
         age_group = cut(age, 
                         breaks = c(0,30, 45, 65, 110), 
                         include.lowest=TRUE))
```
Complainants and victims both tend to be male more commonly than female, but in both cases black complainants and victims are more commonly female than other races. Unsurprisingly, victims tend to be younger than complainants, as a young victim may not be their own complainant. In total racial composition, black individuals comprise `r pcnt(mean(ctable$race == 'Black', na.rm = T))`% of know complainants and `r pcnt(mean(vtable$race == 'Black', na.rm = T))`% of known victims. The next highest, whites, only comprise `r pcnt(mean(ctable$race == 'White', na.rm = T))`% of complainants and `r pcnt(mean(vtable$race == 'White', na.rm = T))`% of victims, followed by Hispanics at `r pcnt(mean(ctable$race == 'White', na.rm = T))`% of complainants and `r pcnt(mean(vtable$race == 'White', na.rm = T))`%. The numbers for Hispanics are surprisingly low, given Chicago being roughly 30% black, white, and Hispanic.

```{r cv_demos_table, cache=TRUE, dependson="cv_demos", results='asis'}
niceTableStacked(list(ctable, vtable), 'race', c('gender', 'age_group', 'complaint_class'), scroll=F, caption = '',  headers=c("Complainants", "Victims"))
```

## Complainants and Accused Officers
Considering the more complete information of complainants, we will continue focusing on their information.
```{r complainants_accused, cache=TRUE, dependson="cv_sample"}
rm(ctable, vtable, vict)
cmplnt <- cmplnt %>%
  mutate(race = recode(race,BLACK = 'Black', HISPANIC = 'Hispanic', WHITE = 'White', .default = 'Other')) %>% 
  select(cr_id, complainant_gender=gender, complainant_race=race, complainant_age=age)

cmpl.c <- cmpl.ot %>% 
  select(cr_id,UID, incident_date, incident_month, incident_year, complaint_class, final_finding, officer_race=race, officer_gender=gender) %>%
  inner_join(cmplnt, 'cr_id')

cao_table <- round(100 * addmargins(prop.table(table(cmpl.c$officer_race, cmpl.c$complainant_race), 1), 2), 2)
```
The table below, displaying complainant racial breakdown with respect to officer race, shows a not unexpected relationship. Black complainants make up a larger share of black officer accusations (`r cao_table['Black', 'Black']`%), while Hispanic complainants maintain their largest share in Hispanic officer complaints (`r cao_table['Hispanic', 'Hispanic']`%).

```{r complainants_accused_table, cache=TRUE, dependson="complainants_accused", results='asis'}

taboa <- round(100 * addmargins(prop.table(table(subset(cmpl.co, final_finding !='NAF')$complainant_race,
                                                 subset(cmpl.co, final_finding !='NAF')$final_finding), 1),2), 2)

)

```

The sustained rates for all civilian accusations are miniscule compared to those of officer complaints. This section only includes the `r nrow(cmpl.co) + nrow(cmpl.cc)` accusations with non-missing final findings. Focusing on accusations with affidavits, white civilian-complainant accusations are sustained at a rate of `r tabca['White', 'SU']`%, which is `r round(tabca['White', 'SU'] / tabca['Black', 'SU'] , 1)` times the rate of black civilian-complainant accusations (`r tabca['Black', 'SU']`%) and `r round(tabca['White', 'SU'] / tabca['Hispanic', 'SU'] , 1)` times the rate of Hispanic. civilian-complainant accusations (`r tabca['Hispanic', 'SU']`%). This is a considerable disparity. In officer filed accusations, there are still racial disparities, but to a lesser extent. Black complainant-officers have their accusations sustained at the lowest rate of `r taboa['Black', 'SU']`%, followed by Hispanic officers (`r taboa['Hispanic', 'SU']`%) and White officers (`r taboa['White', 'SU']`%). Interestingly, Black officer complainants sign affidavits at a lower rate than other officers (`r tabon['Black', 'NAF']`% compared to `r tabon['Hispanic', 'NAF']`% and `r tabon['White', 'NAF']`% for Hispanic and white officers, respectively).
